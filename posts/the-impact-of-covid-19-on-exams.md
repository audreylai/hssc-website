With the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020, and students being unable to attend in person school, many schools proposed the concept of online learning. Nevertheless, there were many downsides to this as many students and teachers struggled with internet problems on both sides, causing it to have been more difficult for teachers to teach, and for students to have been taught. 

Back in 2020, there was the first public outcry from students all over the world taking IB, A-Levels, and (I)GCSE. With campuses having been closed, and not all schools taking the online learning approach, it was decided that for both A-Levels and (I)GCSE, they would use their predicted grades and mocks and run it through an algorithm which would compare their internal assessment results, with their mocks and predicted grades. Though some students were able to keep their initial grades, others suffered massively and as a result had their university spots taken away from them. For IB students however, they did not have to run through an algorithm, but instead had their predicted grades displace their final grades as the final exams were cancelled. 

Most recently in May and June of 2023, both (I)GCSE and IB students sat their exams, but only then found out when the results came out that both IB and (I)GCSE exam boards decided to revoke their ‘sympathy points’. For IB, students were shocked to know that IB had gone back to their pre-covid regulations. This was seen in how the global average went from 24.65 out of 45 in 2019 (pre-covid) compared to the peak during covid regulations in 2021 where the average was 32.98 out of 45, and finally and most recently, in 2023, where the average dropped back down to 30.24 out of 45. Many students were unable to get the grades that they had expected, which were simultaneously also the grades that were required from universities through conditional offers. 

As for (I)GCSE, exam boards stopped providing help to their students for subjects. During 2021 and 2022, certain exam boards would provide helpful tips to their students, advising them on what topics to study in depth. However, in 2023, the tips stopped, causing students to have more to study than in previous years. So far, Shatin College has yet to release any data on the 2023 (I)GCSE results. Nevertheless, comparing the statistics from 2019 and the peak during Covid in 2021, it can be seen that the percentage of students achieving higher grades in 2021 compared to two years prior displays the direct impact covid had to (I)GCSE exams. This was shown in how in 2021, the percentage of students who received grades A* and 9-8 increased by over ten percent.
